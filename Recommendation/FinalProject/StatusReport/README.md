# Status Report

#### Project title

Tea Recommendation System

***

Short answers (at least 3 sentences) for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to rewrite your proposal and email your instructor!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Needed modules, such as Flask and Jinja, have been trouble shooted. Along with this, I have been able to get the list.csv to record any answers as well as have my program alert users if not all fields have been filled out. I've also begun creating preferences/fields for the user to fill out.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to finish coming up with preference fields. Following the completion of this, I will need to come up with different recommendation pages for specific answer combinations and program it in. Apart from the preferences and recommendations, I also need add to my CSV page in order to make the cite look how I want it.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Flask caused so many problems. Widnows didn't want to deal with pip, I didn't have access to certain things, and my terminal was cotnastnatly looking in the wrong directy. However, after a week of trouble shooting, it was finally able to be resolved. Without Flask, my program wouldn't have been able to have function components such as the respose records, and the actual personalized recommendations. Despite it being a pain, I at least was able to familiarize myself with commands such as 'cd' and 'ls' as well as gain a better understadning of how Python, VSCode, and Powershell interact with my computer.
