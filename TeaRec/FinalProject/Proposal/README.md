# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Tea Recommendation System

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a web-based synthesizer.")

My project is about creating a recommendation system that will suggest tea(s) based ont the users preferences.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I plan on writing this code using HTML, Python, CSS, Flask, Jinja, and possibly Java. HTML and CSS will aid me in creating a unifom looking platform in which the system will reside. It will be accessible as a web server. The Index HTML page will house information regarding parameter options that users can choose from as well as the submit button. Other HTML pages will be made up of information regarding the output. For instance, if the user doesn't give enough information, this HTML page will return an error message. The Python page will contain the 'if else' commands that will provide the recommendations and any other necessary functional commands. The Python page will also include Flask so that the answers from the HTML can be routed back into the Python code. Jinja will be used to store data. This will aid in understanding the users preferences and possible improvements. Any possible Java usage will help in creating features such as the "submit button."

Theoretically, in executing the programming correctly, this recommendation system will be able to look at a users preferences and provide a list of recommendations as well as where to buy said suggested products. Data lists will then allow me to understand trends in preferences and any possible correlations. If successful and coherent, this system would then have the capability to translated into any sort of recommendation field and allow for potential data analysis. 

## If you are planning to combine LMSC-261's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to LMSC-261, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish a fully functioning recommendation system that will be able to offer suggestions based off of certain parameters and link the user to where to purchase.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

All answers could be recorded for data purposes. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to be able to incorporate a "rate" feature in which the user can rate a wine, if they tried, and give feedback. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

I will firstly need to researh tea types, tea parameters and where to buy any of the reccomendations. Secondly, I will need to familiarize myself with Flask and Jinja. I understand their capabilities, but having never used them first hand, I will have to explore their features a bit more. Finally, I will need to be prepared to practice toiubleshooting and researching any HTML, CSS, Python, or Java features I might struggle with.
